<h2><em>Some very good potato salad</em></h2>
<h3><p>This is my mother's recipe. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!</p></h3>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups diced peeled potatoes</li>
    <li>4 slices bacon</li>
    <li>1 small onion</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place the potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Place the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp, turning as needed. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add onion to the bacon grease, and cook over medium heat until browned. Add the vinegar, water, sugar, salt and pepper to the pan. Bring to a boil, then add the potatoes and parsley. Crumble in half of the bacon. Heat through, then transfer to a serving dish. Crumble the remaining bacon over the top, and serve warm.</li>
